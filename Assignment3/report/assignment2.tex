The sweep has been done for the variables \t{pause}(low 600, high 1000), which determines the milliseconds of silence the recognizer should take between sentences, \t{gain}(low 0.5, high 1.5), which seemed to control the volume of the mixes, and \t{threshold}(low 27, high 33) which determines at which volume sentences start being recognized. We found that the following settings gave the highest percentages:

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
Pause     & 1000 \\
Gain      & 1    \\
Threshold & 27  
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Calculating the mean of the scores, we found that using high pause with a low threshold gave the best results, with an average percentage of 54.5$\%$. The default settings were around 32$\%$, as most of the other settings. A high threshold showed a sharp decrease in the percentages, up to 4.5$\%$ The full results of the parameter experiments can be found in the Appendix.
