%!TEX root = report.tex

The sweep has been done for the variables pause(low 600, high 1000), gain(low 0.5, high 1.5) and threshold(low 27, high 33). We found that the following settings gave the highest percentages:

Pause: high pause
Gain: default
Threshold: low threshold

Calculating the mean of the scores, we found that using high pause with a low threshold gave the best results, with an average percentage of 54.5$\%$. The default settings were around 32$\%$, as most of the other settings. A high threshold showed a sharp decrease in the percentages, up to 4.5$\%$.
