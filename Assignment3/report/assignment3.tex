We created our own behavior called \t{movetolocation}, in which the programmed got text input, for which it then had to give adequate feedback. We used the NLP class, which was meant for assignment 4, for this assignment already, in order to reduce the complexity of the sentences. This made them easier to parse, meaning less text had to be hard-coded
