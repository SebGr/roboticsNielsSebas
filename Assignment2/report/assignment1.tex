\subsection*{1.a}
For the assignment a launch file has to be created using Gmapping and teleoperation, which would finally save the map. The launch file is as follows:

\lstinputlisting[
	caption={The launch file to map the room.},
	label={lst:1:teleopMap}, 
	language=Python,
	float
]{./src/1/create_map.launch}

In order to get a map, the following commands have to be used in different terminals:

\begin{lstlisting}
	roslaunch navigation exercise1.launch
	roslaunch navigation create_map.launch
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./img/map_teleop.png}
	\caption{The map that was made through mapping with teleop keyboard package.}
	\label{fig:1:map}
\end{figure}

The transformations are done automatically, as mentioned. It is done through the parameter \t{base_frame} in \t{gmapping}, which has a default called \t{base_link}.

\subsection*{1.b}

For this assignment, the map from the first part had to be reused in Rviz, together with amcl. The following commands were necessary:

\begin{lstlisting}
	roslaunch navigation exercise1.launch
	rosrun navigation initPose.py
	roslaunch navigation amcl.launch
\end{lstlisting}

This gave a 2D map in Rviz, as well as the 3D model in gazebo. In order to try and break the representations of the robot between Rviz and Gazebo, a lot of noise was introduced. Using this meant there was more uncertainty about the location, and so the rviz robot was at a different point than the gazebo robot after a while.

\lstinputlisting[
	caption={Teleop with the saved map.},
	label={lst:2:teleopAmcl}, 
	language=Python,
	float
]{./src/1/amcl.launch}

\lstinputlisting[
	caption={Set the estimate position.},
	label={lst:3:initPose}, 
	language=Python,
	float
]{./src/1/initPose.py}

The robot its original position had to be changed with python. This can be seen in the listing \ref{lst:3:initPose}. In order to break the AMCL behavior, we played with the noise. As can be seen in listing \ref{lst:2:teleopAmcl}, we change the parameters for \t{odom_alphaN}, with N going from 1 to 4, to $1.5$ instead of $0.2$. This caused the location of the robot in Rviz to occasionally differ from the representation in Gazebo, which could eventually lead to a permanent difference in location.
