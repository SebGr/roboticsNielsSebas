The interesting part here is the \t{navigate.py} file, which takes the static points and sends them to the \t{move_base}, in order to succesfully travel to them.

The program here ran fine generally, the only issue we occasionally had was when the door would close very late. If the robot was party through the door, then it could destroy the door. Another option would be that it would get stuck behind the table, this could be due to the robot not being able to find a route around the table through the door opening in order to reach the goal.
