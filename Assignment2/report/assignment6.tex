The same robot model was used as in assignment 4, with the exception that a subscriber node listens to whether the goal was reached and when it is reached, that it then prints whether the goal is reached or not. If the goal has failed to have been reached for 3 times, then the goal gets cancelled, as seen in \cref{lst:1:sub}.
